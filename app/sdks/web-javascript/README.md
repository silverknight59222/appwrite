Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way.
                        Use the Web SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

If you're using a bundler (like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)), you can import the Appwrite module when you need it:

```js
import * as Appwrite from "appwrite";
```

```

## Getting Started

Initialise the Appwrite SDK in your code, and setup your API credentials:

```js

// Init your JS SDK
var appwrite = new Appwrite();

appwrite
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Set only when using self-hosted solution
    .setProject('455x34dfkj') // Your Appwrite Project UID
;
