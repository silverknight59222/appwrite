The storage service allows you to manage your project files. You can upload, view, download, and query your files and media.

Each file is granted read and write permissions to manage who has access to view or manage it. You can also learn more about how to manage your [resources permissions](/docs/permissions).

 You can also use the storage file preview endpoint to show the app users preview images of your files. The preview endpoint also allows you to manipulate the resulting image, so it will fit perfectly inside your app.
