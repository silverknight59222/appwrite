Update currently logged in user account email address. After changing user address, the user confirmation status will get reset. A new confirmation email is not sent automatically however and you will need to use the send confirmation email endpoint again. For security measures, user password is required to complete this request.
This endpoint can also be used to convert an anonymous account to a normal one, by passing an email address and a new password.
