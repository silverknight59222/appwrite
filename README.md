Appwrite is a simple to use backend for frontend and mobile apps. Appwrite provides client side (and server) developers with a set of REST APIs to speed up app development time.

Using Appwrite you can easily manage user authentication with multiple sign-in methods, database for storing and querying user and teams data, storage and file management, image manipulation and cropping, scheduled cron tasks and many other features to help you get more results in faster times and with a lot less code.

## Installation

Appwrite backend server is designed to run in a container environment. Running your server is as easy as running one command from your terminal. You can run Appwrite on your localhost using docker-compose or on any other container orchestration tool like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm or Rancher.

The easiest way to start running your Appwrite server is by running our docker compose file:

```bash
mkdir appwrite-ce && \
cd appwrite-ce && \
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://appwrite.io/docker-compose.yml && \
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

Once the Docker installation completes, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please notice that on non-linux native hosts the server might take a few minutes to start after installation completes.
